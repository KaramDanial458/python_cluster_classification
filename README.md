# Python Data Classifiers 

This project was completed for my pattern recognition class involving MED, ML, MAP, and kNN classification methods. Each classifier is constructed based on a set of test data and later tested on a different dataset and evaluated for accuracy. Accuracy is measured and described through mean squared error calculations and pictures of confusion matrices detailing the accuracy of each classifier respectively. A meshgrid is used to draw the decision bondary of all classifiers for data sets from 2 and 3 classes. Below is a set of pictures showing the results of MED, MAP, and kNN approaches:
